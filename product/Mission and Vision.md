# Fleet Dashboard — Vision & Mission

## What is Fleet Dashboard?
**Fleet Dashboard is Howlers’ internal command center for managing and monitoring autonomous agent execution across projects.**

It provides real-time visibility into blades/sessions, issue throughput, PR pipeline health, loop failures, and milestone progress — all in one operational surface.

## Mission
Give the Howlers team a single, reliable control plane to run the code fleet with speed, confidence, and accountability.

## Vision (3 years)
Fleet Dashboard becomes the default operational cockpit for autonomous software delivery at Howlers: every issue, blade, PR, and milestone is visible, measurable, and steerable in real time.

## Core Values
- **Operational clarity first** — if status is ambiguous, trust breaks.
- **Intervention over surprises** — detect stuck/failed loops early.
- **Speed with control** — reduce latency without sacrificing safety.
- **Evidence-driven execution** — every action has telemetry and traceability.
- **Internal leverage** — optimize for Howlers workflows before externalization.

## Core Strategies
1. Build a live fleet status graph across issues, blades, PRs, and milestones.
2. Make blocked/stalled work impossible to miss via health scoring + alerts.
3. Use Supabase as the canonical operational data layer for dashboards and automation.
4. Close the loop with direct actions (relaunch, steer, review, merge) from context-rich views.

## Known Unknowns
- Which fleet metrics are most predictive of delivery delays?
- What alert thresholds minimize noise while catching real failures?
- How much of incident response can be automated safely?
